# Movie Website - README

# What kind of website did you make and why?
I made a movie-themed website that highlights my favorite films, my credibility in choosing them, and related content such as actors and a gallery of movie posters. I chose this topic because I enjoy movies and wanted to create an engaging, interactive website to share my preferences.
