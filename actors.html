        First is Brad Pitt, I think that his new F1 movie was amazing.  
        Second would be Tom Cruise, I believe he is one of the greatest because of the Mission Impossible franchise.  
        Third would be Robert Downey Junior for his work with Iron Man.  
        I also really like Christian Bale, because he is my favorite Batman actor.  
        Lastly, my fifth would be Leo DiCaprio, and he was just amazing in every movie he has ever made.
